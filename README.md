## About Me
Hello! I'm Saijal Singhal, a Computer Engineering student with a strong foundation in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision. I love building intelligent systems and in my journey, I have had the privilege of working on cutting-edge projects and contributing to the ever-evolving field of AI. Outside of tech, I’m passionate about UX design, painting, and calligraphy — and I believe creativity fuels innovation, even in code!
